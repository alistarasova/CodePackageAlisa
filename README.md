Code Package for Project by Alisa Tarasova

What all of the functions you wrote to create your drawings do.
- All of the functions are meant to be used in order to create colored shapes in different pattern manner via Turtle using ColabTurtlePlus.Turtle in GoogleColab

Your working method for creating your program.
- Collecting anonymous data from Pratt Institute students during the day of ComD Thesis presentation. Data was collected and writen in Google.XL. Data was then cleaned and modified in OpenReFine and saved in csv format. Each emotion that people called is associated with certain color and prevalence of emotions in one day by one person is associated with shape. Instalment of ColabTurtlePlus.Turtle in GoogleColab. Work on visualisation of data collected in GoogleColab using Turtles. Refiment of itterations created, most succesful 5 that represented data for each anonymous person in questionnaire. Creation of GooglePages webpage and importing GoogleXL questionnaire and most succesful emotions visualisations along with other iterations created. Refiment of the page to look representative. Link submitted via canvas in "Project Presentation" assigment.

Difficulties you encountered along the way.
- Students not eager to participate in anonymous questionnaire. Not enough time during exam day to collect enough data for anonymous questionnaire (plan was to have 10 participants min). No desire to pay Microsoft to use Microsoft.XL forced to use Google.XL. Google.Xl interface. Openrefine not wanting to load and not wanting to save data in csv file, even though it was asked politely to do so many times. Openrefine saving file damaged. Redoing the file in Openrefine. Writing each of my steps of project in Google.Collab, even though they seem obvious. Having no extra words to describe my process in Google.Collab. Turtles functions being long and confusing. Having to rewrite Turtles function. Turtle functions taking to much time to load and process visualization (not the function for person 4 visualization). Creation of GooglePages webpage and importing GoogleXL questionnaire and most succesful emotions visualisations along with other iterations created. GooglePages UI and UX. Refiment of the page to look representative. GITHUB.
